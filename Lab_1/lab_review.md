# Lab 1 -- GHDL and GTKWave Practice
**Using vhdl entity and testbenches, make use of both GHDL and GTKWave as a wave visualizer.**

### Half Adder
You begin by usign GHDL to analyze the two files, a testbench and a top entity of the half adder, and eventually execute the testbench.
After gathering the outputs as a function of time, we can run the GTKWave file.

A half adder should sum two bit values: `a` and `b` here.
The results will go into the sum, or the carry bit, represented by `s` and `c`, respectively.

### D-Flip Flop
You begin by usign GHDL to analyze the two files, a testbench and a top entity of the D-Flip FLop, and eventually execute the testbench.
After gathering the outputs as a function of time, we can run the GTKWave file.
